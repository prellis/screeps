* My Screeps Architecture

This page will explain the software components and interactions
implemented in this project.

* Main Loop

The main loop does only a few things:

  * Cull dead creeps
  * Spawn new creeps
  * Invoke each living creep to do something

[[./main_loop.png]]

* Harvester

Harvesters are creeps who are responsible for gathering resources.
They are state machines with simple functionality.  The states are as
follows:

  * Commuting

    Either moving from the spawn to a source to collect resources OR
    moving from the source back to the spawn to deliver the
    collected resources.

    [[./harvester_commuting.png]]

  * Harvesting

    Transferring resources from a source to storage on the creep.

    [[./harvester_harvesting.png]]

  * Delivering

    Transferring resources from creep storage into the spawn.

    [[./harvester_delivering.png]]


* Upgrader
